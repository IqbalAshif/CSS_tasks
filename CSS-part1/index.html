            <p> Linux (/ˈlinʊks/ (About this soundlisten) LEEN-uuks or /ˈlɪnʊks/ LIN-uuks[9]) is a family of open-source
                Unix-like operating systems based on the Linux kernel,[10] an operating system kernel first released on
                September 17, 1991, by Linus Torvalds.[11][12][13] Linux is typically packaged in a Linux distribution.

                Distributions include the Linux kernel and supporting system software and libraries, many of which are
                provided
                by the GNU Project. Many Linux distributions use the word "Linux" in their name, but the Free Software
                Foundation uses the name GNU/Linux to emphasize the importance of GNU software, causing some
                controversy.[14][15]

                <span id="distro"> Linux distributions[16][17][18] include Debian, Fedora, and Ubuntu. Commercial
                    distributions include
                    Red
                    Hat Enterprise Linux and SUSE Linux Enterprise Server.</span> Desktop Linux distributions include a
                windowing
                system
                such as X11 or Wayland, and a desktop environment such as GNOME or KDE Plasma. Distributions intended
                for
                servers may omit graphics altogether, or include a solution stack such as LAMP. Because Linux is freely
                redistributable, anyone may create a distribution for any purpose.[19]
            </p>
            <p id="second-para">Linux was originally developed for personal computers based on the Intel x86
                architecture, but has since been
                ported to more platforms than any other operating system.[20] Because of the dominance of Android on
                smartphones, Linux also has the largest installed base of all general-purpose operating
                systems.[21][22][23]
                Although it is used by only around 2.3 percent of desktop computers,[24][25] the Chromebook, which runs
                the
                Linux kernel-based Chrome OS, dominates the US K–12 education market and represents nearly 20 percent of
                sub-$300 notebook sales in the US.[26] Linux is the leading operating system on servers (over 96.4% of
                the
                top 1 million web servers' operating systems are Linux),[27] leads other big iron systems such as
                mainframe
                computers, and is the only OS used on TOP500 supercomputers (since November 2017, having gradually
                eliminated all competitors).[28][29][30]</p>
            <p id="third-para">Linux also runs on embedded systems, i.e. devices whose operating system is typically
                built into the firmware
                and is highly tailored to the system. This includes routers, automation controls, smart home technology
                (like Google Nest),[31] televisions (Samsung and LG Smart TVs use Tizen and WebOS,
                respectively),[32][33][34] automobiles (for example, Tesla, Audi, Mercedes-Benz, Hyundai, and Toyota all
                rely on Linux),[35] digital video recorders, video game consoles, and smartwatches.[36] The Falcon 9's
                and
                the Dragon 2's avionics use a customized version of Linux.[37]

                Linux is one of the most prominent examples of free and open-source software collaboration. The source
                code
                may be used, modified and distributed commercially or non-commercially by anyone under the terms of its
                respective licenses, such as the GNU General Public License.[19]

                90% of all cloud infrastructure is powered by Linux including supercomputers and cloud providers.[38]
                74% of
                smartphones in the world are Linux-base1d.[39]</p>
